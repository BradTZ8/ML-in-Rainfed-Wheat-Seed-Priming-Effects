# ML-in-Rainfed-Wheat-Seed-Priming-Effects
This project applies machine learning models to study the effects of seed priming on rainfed wheat performance. The main goal is to predict wheat yield and related agronomic traits under limited-water conditions, based on experimental data collected from seed priming treatments.
